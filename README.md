## Loyalty Points Fee Hook

The Loyalty Points Fee Hook is a Uniswap V4 hook that tracks of the volume traded and LP provided by users. Users are awarded points, which can give a discount on trading fees in pools with this hook attached.

‚öôÔ∏è Built using Solidity, Arbitrum Stylus, Uniswap V4 and Foundry

- üåü **Earn Points**: Earn loyalty points by trading in the pool or providing liquidity. Higher gas prices mean more points earned per transaction.
- üí∞ **Dynamic Fees**: Get discounted trading fees based on your points balance. The more points you have, the lower your fees.
- ‚è∞ **Stay Active**: Points expire over time unless you remain active in the pool through trading or liquidity provision.
- ‚õΩ **Gas Bonus**: Earn bonus points during high gas periods to reward users who help maintain pool activity when network is congested.

## Hook description

This hook is built on top of [Uniswap V4 Template](https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/v4-template).

1. The Loyalty Points Fee hook [LoyaltyPointsFeeHook.sol](src/LoyaltyPointsFeeHook.sol) uses:
    - `constructor` takes _baseFee and _expirationBlocks as arguments to determine the base fee (without discount) and how many blocks of inactivity will makes points expire.
    - `beforeSwap()` hook first checks the users most recent activity. If the user has been inactive too long, his points are reset. Then it calculates the fee with via the [implementation written in Stylus](https://github.com/arjanjohan/loyalty-points-fee-hook-stylus),
    - `afterSwap()` hook calculates the amount of points earned with the swap,
    - `getHookPermissions()` function.  
2. The test template [LoyaltyPointsFeeHook.t.sol](test/LoyaltyPointsFeeHook.t.sol) preconfigures the v4 pool manager, test tokens, and test liquidity.
3. [IFeeLogic.sol](src/interface/IFeeLogic.sol) is the interface for the [Stylus contract](https://github.com/arjanjohan/loyalty-points-fee-hook-stylus). I have also written an implementation of this in Solidity in [FeeLogic.sol](src/FeeLogic.sol).

## Next steps

I will implement first a basic version of the hook, then keep adding more sophisticated features along the way.
- Earn more points when gas is high
- Allow non-native token pairs
- Relative ranking for tiers
- Finalize Stylus contract implementation
